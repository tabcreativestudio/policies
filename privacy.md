**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

Thrift ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Account Information**: When you create an account, we collect your email address and display name. If you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive basic profile information from those services.
- **User Content**: Photos you take within the app to scan clothing items.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Location Data**: With your permission, we collect your location to show nearby thrift stores. This data is used only while the app is in use and is not stored on our servers.
- **Usage Data**: We track scan counts to enforce daily limits and improve our service.

### Camera Access
We request camera access solely to photograph clothing items for scanning and identification. Photos are processed to provide price estimates and are not stored permanently on our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
- Provide and improve our clothing identification and pricing service
- Find and display thrift stores near your location
- Manage your account and subscription
- Enforce usage limits (100 scans per day)
- Communicate with you about your account or the service

## Third-Party Services

### AI Processing
Photos you scan are sent to OpenAI's API for analysis. Images are processed to identify clothing items and estimate resale values. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by their privacy policy. We do not send personally identifiable information with image data.

### Firebase (Google)
We use Firebase for:
- User authentication
- Cloud functions processing
- Usage tracking (scan counts)

### eBay
Search queries generated from scans may be used to find comparable listings on eBay. No personal information is shared with eBay.

## Data Storage and Security

- Account data is stored securely using Firebase/Google Cloud
- Scan count data is retained for 30 days then deleted
- We do not sell your personal information to third parties
- We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Location**: You can disable location access in your device settings

- **Data Access**: Contact us to request a copy of your data

## Children's Privacy

Thrift is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
